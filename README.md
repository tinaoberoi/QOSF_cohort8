QOSF Task cohort 8

Problem Statement

Task1: Find the primes numbers

Given a positive integer and an list of prime numbers, look for the two prime numbers, that sum the positive number. Consider an appropriate number of qubits and explain why your proposal is valid for all kinds of numbers in case

```
def find_the_primes_numbers (int:number_1, list[int] ,number_2):
     “””
 number_1 : integer value that is the positive number to decompose,
number_2 : integer list that has two prime numbers to add to obtain number_1.
Return the number_a and number_b
     “””

     # use a framework that works with quantum circuits, qiskit, cirq, pennylane, etc. 

      # consider print your quantum circuit,

```

```
Example:

A = find_the_primes_numbers (18,[1,3,5,7,11,13,15])
print(A)

“3,15”
```
